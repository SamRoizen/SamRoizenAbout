		>Welcome to my personal website! My name is Sam Roizen, and I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for creating products that make a difference. I'm also interested in technical project management and video editing, which allows me to bring a unique perspective to my work.
		<br></br><br></br>
		As a full-stack developer, I have experience working with a variety of front-end and back-end technologies, which enables me to create robust and scalable applications. I enjoy taking on new challenges and am always looking for ways to improve my skills.
		<br></br><br></br>
		In addition to my technical expertise, I'm also interested in project management, which I believe is crucial to the success of any project. I strive to be an effective communicator and collaborator, ensuring that everyone is on the same page and that deadlines are met.

		As a video editor, I enjoy using my creative talents to tell stories that resonate with people. I pay attention to details, and I'm always looking for ways to make a video stand out.</p>
